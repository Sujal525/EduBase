## 🧠 Team & Approach

### Team Name:  
`Quantum Devs`

### Team Members:  
- Sujal Dhruve  
- Devang Chudasama  
- Darshit Virani
- Krish Savaliya  


### Your Approach:

While building EduBase, we encountered several challenges, particularly with the integration of blockchain technology, AI models, and wallet services. Here are the key hurdles we faced and how we overcame them:

1. Blockchain Integration with Coinbase and Metamask
Challenge:
Integrating Coinbase Wallet and Metamask for minting credentials and secure wallet connections was complex.
Solution:
We used OAuth authentication and worked with Coinbase and Metamask APIs to ensure secure wallet connections and smooth transactions, offering a seamless user experience.
2. AI Integration with Groq Models
Challenge:
Integrating Groq-powered AI Tutor and Evaluator Agents for real-time feedback and personalized tutoring posed a technical challenge in managing AI responses efficiently.
Solution:
We optimized Groq's models by pre-training them on relevant educational data, ensuring instant, accurate, and personalized responses.
3. Zero Knowledge Test Implementation
Challenge:
Implementing Zero Knowledge Tests to verify knowledge without revealing sensitive data required complex cryptographic work.
Solution:
We researched cryptographic protocols and collaborated with blockchain experts to implement Zero Knowledge Proofs, maintaining privacy and verifiability of test results.
4. Proof of Knowledge Certificates with QR Codes and JSON Preview
Challenge:
Generating Proof of Knowledge Certificates with QR codes and JSON previews that are verifiable on the blockchain required seamless integration of backend and frontend.
Solution:
We used blockchain APIs to generate certificates and integrated QR code generation libraries for instant, downloadable, verifiable certificates.
5. User Experience (UX) Challenges
Challenge:
Ensuring the platform was user-friendly, especially for those unfamiliar with blockchain, was a major concern.
Solution:
We focused on a simple, intuitive UI with clear instructions and tooltips to guide users through blockchain and AI features.

These challenges were met with perseverance, collaboration with Coinbase and Groq, and a focus on user experience, resulting in a secure, scalable, and efficient platform that addresses real-world issues in education.
